Various Modules for Arduino
=

Modules that are made in this repo are tested on:
- Arduino UNO

The state machine is a basic state machine using _if else if else_ method. Nothing flashy. 

Each module should be used only in state machine, and should call reset and init pins in state machine reset and init pins methods. 

Images for wirings and example programs will be added in separate timing on master branch.
